abstract = {Delta Mush is a Voodoo deformer, developed by Rhythm & Hues, which smooths arbitrary deformation of a polygonal mesh without smoothing the original detail of the model. Delta Mush does not require meticulous up-front tuning: it easily accommodates model and rig changes; and it has proven to be versatile far beyond cleanup. It has been used in all character rigs at R&H since it was developed in 2010. By making bad deformations good, Delta Mush helps facilitate an efficient character workflow: riggers can use simpler binds and coarser deformers; animators have access to interactive, realtime rigs; and crowds can incorporate hero-quality deformations globally because they are so lightweight.},
